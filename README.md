This is a spigot based Jump 'n' Run minigame. It's almost like the gamemode 'JumpLeague' on the GommeHD.net server but with a few changes. The plugin contains its own building system, which can be used to build your own modules.

**Important**! It is highly recommended using this plugin in a cloud-system based environment like [CloudNET](https://cloudnetservice.eu/). 

## Features

- Module randomizer
- Module building system
- Quick editor
- API
- Holograms
- Particle system
- Small head database
- Multiple maps
- Fully customizable
- Multiple languages

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.voxcrafterlp</groupId>
  <artifactId>JumpRace</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.2-RELEASE</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

```

### Events

**Available events**:
- ModuleFailEvent
- PlayerCompleteModuleEvent
- PlayerReachGoalEvent
- TeamWinEvent
  
**Example**
```java
public class Example implements Listener {

    private static final HashMap<Player, Integer> fails = new HashMap<>();

    @EventHandler
    public void onFail(ModuleFailEvent event) {
        final Player player = event.getPlayer();

        if(fails.containsKey(player))
            fails.replace(player, fails.get(player) + 1);
        else
            fails.put(player, 1);
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onReach(PlayerReachGoalEvent event) {
        final Player player = event.getPlayer();

        if(fails.containsKey(player)) {
            player.sendMessage("§fYou failed §c" + fails.get(player) + " times.");
        } else
            player.getInventory().setHelmet(new ItemStack(Material.DIAMOND_HELMET));
    }

}
```

## Languages

At the moment these languages are available:
```
- en_US (American English) (default)
- de_DE (German)
- de_CH (Swiss German)
```

If you want to add your own language file, you can copy an existing translation file from the `plugins/JumpRace/languages` folder and translate it. 
**Important! You have to encode the translation file in ISO-8859-1.**
To enable the translation, you have to change the language file in the config.
